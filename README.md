# Essential Personal .vimrc

This is the repository to hold my personal `.vimrc` that I use with macVim.
However, this should work with any other types of vim editors across the
platforms. Feel free to use it and modify as you like.

In order to take advantage of all the features in this `.vimrc`, you will
need the following:
* **Vundle**: Vundle is my preferred choice of Vim plugin manager. To install
plugins, you will need to type `:PluginInstall` the first time you open your
Vim editor. Here is the [documentation](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
* **Powerline Fonts**: To make the Vim-Airline plugin look really slick,
you will need to install Powerline fonts. Please see [Powerline documentation](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
