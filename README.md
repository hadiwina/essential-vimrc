# Essential Personal .vimrc

This is the repository to hold my personal `.vimrc` that I use with macVim.
However, this should work with any other types of vim editors across the
platforms.

In order to take advantage of all the features in this `.vimrc`, you will
need the following:
* **Vundle**: Vundle is my preferred choice of Vim plugin manager. To install
plugins, you will need to type `:PluginInstall` the first time you open your
Vim editor.
* **Powerline Fonts**: To make the Vim-Airline plugin look really slick,
you will need to install Powerline fonts. Please see [Powerline documentation](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
